# Welcome to the new nnSAM!

## Our entire code is built based on nnUNet, and you can follow the nnUNet instructions exactly.


Install nnU-Net depending on your use case:

```bash
conda create -n nnsam python=3.9
conda activate nnsam
pip install git+https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM.git
pip install timm
pip install git+https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/nnSAM.git
```

## Where does nnU-net perform well and where does it not perform?
nnU-Net excels in segmentation problems that need to be solved by training from scratch, 
for example: research applications that feature non-standard image modalities and input channels,
challenge datasets from the biomedical domain, majority of 3D segmentation problems, etc . We have yet to find a 
dataset for which nnU-Net's working principle fails!

Note: On standard segmentation 
problems, such as 2D RGB images in ADE20k and Cityscapes, fine-tuning a foundation model (that was pretrained on a large corpus of 
similar images, e.g. Imagenet 22k, JFT-300M) will provide better performance than nnU-Net! That is simply because these 
models allow much better initialization. Foundation models are not supported by nnU-Net as 
they 1) are not useful for segmentation problems that deviate from the standard setting (see above mentioned 
datasets), 2) would typically only support 2D architectures and 3) conflict with our core design principle of carefully adapting 
the network topology for each dataset (if the topology is changed one can no longer transfer pretrained weights!) 

## What happened to the old nnU-Net?
The core of the old nnU-Net was hacked together in a short time period while participating in the Medical Segmentation 
Decathlon challenge in 2018. Consequently, code structure and quality were not the best. Many features 
were added later on and didn't quite fit into the nnU-Net design principles. Overall quite messy, really. And annoying to work with.

nnU-Net V2 is a complete overhaul. The "delete everything and start again" kind. So everything is better 
(in the author's opinion haha). While the segmentation performance [remains the same](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13gqjIKEMPFPyMMMwA1EML57IyoBjfC3-QCTn4zRN_Mg/edit?usp=sharing), a lot of cool stuff has been added. 
It is now also much easier to use it as a development framework and to manually fine-tune its configuration to new 
datasets. A big driver for the reimplementation was also the emergence of [Helmholtz Imaging](http://helmholtz-imaging.de), 
prompting us to extend nnU-Net to more image formats and domains. Take a look [here](documentation/changelog.md) for some highlights.
